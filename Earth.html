    <p><span>Earthquakes</span> can have a wide range of effects, varying in severity depending on factors such as the quake’s magnitude, the depth of its epicentre and the local geology.</p>
     <h2>Here are some of the primary effects caused by earthquakes:</h2>

Ground Shaking: When an earthquake occurs, the release of energy creates seismic waves that cause the ground to shake. The intensity of the shaking can vary depending on factors such as the magnitude of the earthquake, the distance from the epicentre and the local geology. Areas closer to the epicentre usually experience more intense shaking, which can significantly damage structures and infrastructure.<br/>
Damage to Man-Made Structures: One of the most noticeable effects of an earthquake is the damage it can cause to buildings, bridges, roads and other man-made structures. The shaking can lead to structural failure, collapse and extensive damage, especially if the buildings are not designed or constructed to withstand seismic activity. The severity of the damage depends on factors such as the quality of construction, adherence to building codes and proximity to the epicentre.
<p>Fires and Hazardous Chemical Spills: Earthquakes can trigger secondary hazards, such as fires and hazardous material spills. The violent shaking can rupture gas pipelines, damage electrical systems and disrupt infrastructure, leading to the ignition of fires. Additionally, earthquakes can cause the release of hazardous chemicals stored in industrial facilities, posing risks to human health and the environment. These secondary effects can further exacerbate the impact of an earthquake and complicate rescue and recovery efforts.<br/>
Landslides and Avalanches: In areas with steep slopes or unstable terrain, earthquakes can trigger landslides and avalanches. The shaking can destabilize slopes, causing rocks, soil and debris to slide downhill. Landslides can damage structures, block roads and even bury entire communities, leading to additional casualties and hindering rescue and relief operations access.<br/>
Tsunamis: Underwater earthquakes can generate tsunamis, particularly those occurring along tectonic plate boundaries. These massive ocean waves can travel long distances, reaching coastal areas and causing devastating flooding. Tsunamis pose a significant threat to coastal communities and can result in widespread destruction and loss of life.</p>
<p>Understanding the potential effects of earthquakes is crucial for implementing appropriate mitigation measures and developing effective disaster response plans. It is important to note that these are just some of the effects that earthquakes can have. The severity and extent of these effects depend on various factors, including the earthquake’s characteristics, the impacted area’s location and the affected communities’ preparedness and resilience</p>
