    <p><span>Floods</span> are the most frequent type of natural disaster and occur when an overflow of water submerges land that is usually dry. Floods are often caused by heavy rainfall, rapid snowmelt or a storm surge from a tropical cyclone or tsunami in coastal areas.</p>

<p>Floods can cause widespread devastation, resulting in loss of life and damages to personal property and critical public health infrastructure. Between 1998-2017, floods affected more than 2 billion people worldwide. People who live in floodplains or non-resistant buildings, or lack warning systems and awareness of flooding hazard, are most vulnerable to floods.
Floods affect more people than any other natural disaster and they have been the most common cause for activating the Charter since it was founded in 2000. Flooding occurs when bodies of water flow onto land that is normally dry. The source of this overflowing water varies and some of the most common causes are:</p>

<p>Storms and torrential rain - Storms often bring large quantities of precipitation, either slowly over a period of days, or in a matter of minutes in the case of flash floods.
Overflowing rivers, lakes, and oceans - External sources such as rain, snow melt, or obstructions, can cause the water level in rivers and lakes to rise, spilling over and out onto surrounding land. Tsunami's are a much more dramatic form of overflow, when large waves crash into shore; typically due to underwater earthquakes.
When floods inundate inhabited areas they have immediate and long-term consequences.</p>

<p>The immediate impact is disruption; flood water can block transportation routes, isolating parts of cities or entirely cutting off access to remote communities. Large quantities of water may sweep away fragile buildings and bridges, and damage electrical supplies. Agriculture can also suffer greatly with crops being destroyed or livestock drowning</p>
