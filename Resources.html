        <p>Risk assessment for disasters focuses on identifying, analyzing, and evaluating the potential risks associated with natural or man-made disasters. The goal is to understand the likelihood and potential impact of such events, enabling communities, organizations, and governments to develop strategies to minimize damage, protect lives, and ensure a swift recovery.</p>

        <p> Creating an emergency plan for natural disasters is crucial to ensure safety and preparedness. Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you develop a plan:</p>
        <h2>Develop a Family Communication Plan</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><span>Contact Information:</span>
            Ensure every family member has a list of emergency contacts.
            Designate an out-of-town contact person as it may be easier to reach someone outside the disaster area.</li>
            <li><span>Communication Methods:</span>
            Text messages are often more reliable than phone calls during disasters.
            Use social media or emergency contact apps to keep everyone informed.</li>
            <li><span>Regular Drills:</span>
            Conduct regular emergency drills (e.g., fire drills, evacuation drills).
            Review and update your plan annually.</li>
